## Demo notes

[IRISDatabaseOperationsUsingSQL.ipynb](IRISDatabaseOperationsUsingSQL.ipynb), [llama_demo.ipynb](llama_demo.ipynb), and [langchain_demo.ipynb](langchain_demo.ipynb) assume you followed the instructions in the quickstart to run a containerized instance of IRIS on your computer. 

In order to run an iris container in a notebook (eg. If you're using colab), refer to [iris_notebook_container.ipynb](demo/iris_notebook_container.ipynb). 

For more details on our vector SQl syntax, refer to [SQLSyntax.md](demo/SQLSyntax.md) or the [product documentation](https://docs.intersystems.com/iris20241/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=GSQL_vecsearch).

You may refer to https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=PAGE_deployment for setting up of InterSystems IRIS
